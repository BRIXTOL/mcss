# ðŸª¡ mcss (alpha-release)

Class selector completion and obfuscation support for [mithril](https://mithril.js.org) projects that are bundled with Rollup. MCSS is a build time development extension. It creates a fugazi method on the `m` export that provides class name intellisense and obfuscation capabilities.

> This tool is developed for use with [mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org), it cannot be appropriated into different frameworks.

### Install

```cli
pnpm add @brixtol/mcss -D
```

_Because [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/cli/install) is dope and does dope shit_

### Usage

Below is an example using [rollup-plugin-scss](#) which allows us to pass transpiled code to postCSS via its `processor` field. If you are not processing SASS/SCSS files then you can use the [rollup-plugin-postcss](#) plugin and add the `mcss.postcss()` method to the `plugins[]` field.

```js
import mcss from '@brixtol/mcss';
import scss from 'rollup-plugin-scss';
import sass from 'node-sass';
import postcss from 'postcss'
import clean from 'postcss-clean'
import autoprefixer from 'node-autoprefixer';
import { terser } from 'rollup-plugin-terser';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',

    sourcemap: false,
    plugins: [

        clean: false;
        /**

        warnUnknown: true;

         * @default []
         */
        ignore: [];

      }),
      terser()
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    scss({
      sass,
      output: 'dist/style.min.css',
      watch: 'src',
      processor: () => postcss([
        autoprefixer(),
        clean(),
        mcss.postcss()
      ])
    })
  ]
};
```

### Typings

The module works by generating a type declaration of class names. By default, it writes the generated typings to the `types/mcss.d.ts` directory in your root directory.

> If you find that new selectors are not showing in completions then you may need to restart the typescript language server.

##### Configure `tsconfig.json`

_TODO_

### Obfuscation

Class names can be obfuscated. Obfuscation can help reduce bundle size because it renames classes to single letter and/or number combinations. This is very helpful when you are working on a large project as it reduces both the production size of your stylesheet and javascript files.

##### Before Obfuscation

Your css:

```css
.some-class-name {
}
.another-class-name {
}
```

Your mithril node:

```js
m('.some-class-name.another-class-name');
```

##### After Obfuscation

Your css:

```css
.a {
}
.b {
}
```

Your mithril node:

```js
m('.a.b');
```

### Example

The plugin allows selectors to be expressed as if they apart of Mithril API available as a method of the `m` default export. MCSS will generates type declarations that extends the Static interface of the mithril module giving the impression that mithril provides the capability (FYI: it doesn't). It's important to note that the tag name, which one can normally be omitted in hyperScript is required when using mcss.

Below is an example of how you express mcss selectors:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
m(
  m.css.div(
    'row',
    'jc-center'
  )
  , m(
    m.css.div(
      'col',
      'col-sm-6',
      'col-lg-12'
    )
  , m(
      m.css.ul('list')
      , m(m.css.li('list-item'), 'one')
      , m(m.css.li('list-item'), 'two')
      , m(m.css.li('list-item')
      , {
          // m.css.class() will split classes by space character
          class: m.css.class('foo', 'bar')
        }
        , 'three'
      )
    )
  )
);
```

Rollup will replace all instances of the selector upon when building the output. Each mcss selector that is encountered is swapped out with its valid equivalent:

```js
m(
  "div.row.jc-center"
  m(
    "div.col",
    m("ul.list",
      m("li.list-item", "one"),
      m("li.list-item", "two"),
      m("li.list-item", { class: 'foo bar' }, "three")
    )
  )
);
```

Essentially, the selector tag we are using is just sugar. It holds not value outside of the development process. If we are obfuscating then those generated selectors will output in a short-name variation, as an example, the above code would output something like this:

```js
m(
  "div.a.b"
  m(
    "div.c.d.e",
    m("ul.f",
      m("li.g", "one"),
      m("li.g", "two"),
      m("li.g", { class: 'h i' }, "three")
    )
  )
);
```

> When you only need to express the class name itself, use `m.css.class('name')` and mcss will replace selectors expressed here using a single whitespace separator.

## Unknown Selectors

When mcss encounter a selector that is not defined in your stylesheets is will print a warning to the console and list all the classes which are missing class selectors. You can suppress this warning by setting `warnUnknown` to `false` or alternatively you can add those selectors to the `ignore[]` option. The module assumes that all defined class selectors you are expressing in your mithril with the `m.css.*` method are css class names.

#### Caveats

There are a couple of very minor caveats to this approach, they are listed below:

1. You cannot pass variables and must express classes as value wrapped in quotation characters
2. You cannot perform actions on supplied selectors, eg: `m.css.div(i > 1 ? 'foo' : 'bar')`
