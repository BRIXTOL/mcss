## ðŸŽ­ mcss

Class selector completion and obfuscation support for [mithril](https://mithril.js.org) projects bundled with Rollup. MCSS is a build time development extension. It creates a fugazi method on the `m` export that provides class name intellisense and obfuscation capabilities.

> This tool is developed for use with [mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org), it cannot be appropriated into different frameworks.

### Install

```cli
pnpm add @brixtol/mcss -D
```

_Because [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/cli/install) is dope and does dope shit_

### Usage

Below is an example using [rollup-plugin-scss](#) which allows us to pass transpiled code to postCSS via its `processor` field. If you are not processing SASS/SCSS files then you can use the [rollup-plugin-postcss](#) plugin and add the `mcss.postcss()` method to the `plugins[]` field.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import mcss from '@brixtol/mcss';
import scss from 'rollup-plugin-scss';
import sass from 'node-sass';
import postcss from 'postcss'
import clean from 'postcss-clean'
import autoprefixer from 'node-autoprefixer';
import { terser } from 'rollup-plugin-terser';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',
    format: 'es',
    sourcemap: false,
    plugins: [
      mcss({
        // Files to include (optional)
        include: [],

        // Files to exclude (optional)
        exclude:[],

        // Generate sourcemaps (optional)
        sourcemap: true,

        // When true, obfuscation is applied (defaults to false)
        obfuscate: env.prod === 'true',

        // The location where class name maps are stored
        cacheDir: 'node_modules/.cache/mcss',

        // The location where class name typings are stored.
        typesDir: 'node_modules/@brixtol/mcss',

      }),
      terser()
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    scss({
      sass,
      output: 'dist/style.min.css',
      watch: 'src',
      processor: () => postcss([
        autoprefixer(),
        clean(),
        mcss.postcss({

          // obfuscate classes with this alphabet
          alphabet: 'abcefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_-',

          // classes with this prefix will be omitted from obfuscation
          ignorePrefix: 'ignore-',

          // Whether or not the ignore prefix should be removed.
          trimIgnorePrefix: true,

        })
      ])
    })
  ]
};
```

### Typings

The module works by generating a type declaration of class names. By default, it writes the generated typing to the `node_modules/@brixtol/mcss` directory. This might _feel_ wrong but the types are constantly being re-generated, it does not really matter that it overwrites that default declaration because it is an empty type (eg: `Array<string>`). It's only after class names have been mapped that the type is populated.

> If you find that new selectors are not showing in completions then you may need to restart the typescript language server.

### Obfuscation

Class names can be obfuscated. Obfuscation can help reduce bundle size because it renames classes to single letter and/or number combinations. This is very helpful when you are working on a large project as it reduces both the production size of your stylesheet and javascript files.

##### Before Obfuscation

Your css:

```css
.some-class-name {
}
.another-class-name {
}
```

Your mithril node:

```js
m('.some-class-name.another-class-name');
```

##### After Obfuscation

Your css:

```css
.a {
}
.b {
}
```

Your mithril node:

```js
m('.a.b');
```

### Example

The plugin allows selectors to be expressed as if they apart of Mithril API available as a method of the `m` default export. MCSS will generates type declarations that extends the Static interface of the mithril module giving the impression that mithril provides the capability (FYI: it doesn't). It's important to note that the tag name, which one can normally omit in hyperScript is required when using mcss.

Below is an example of how you express mcss selectors:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
m(
  m.css.div(
    'row',
    'jc-center'
  )
  , m(
    m.css.div(
      'col',
      'col-sm-6',
      'col-lg-12'
    )
  , m(
      m.css.ul('list')
      , m(m.css.li('list-item'), 'one')
      , m(m.css.li('list-item'), 'two')
      , m(m.css.li('list-item')
      , {
          // m.css.class() will split classes by space character
          class: m.css.class('foo', 'bar')
        }
        , 'three'
      )
    )
  )
);
```

Rollup will replace all instances of the selector upon when building the output. Each mcss selector that is encountered is swapped out with its valid equivalent:

```js
m(
  "div.row.jc-center"
  m(
    "div.col",
    m("ul.list",
      m("li.list-item", "one"),
      m("li.list-item", "two"),
      m("li.list-item", { class: 'foo bar' }, "three")
    )
  )
);
```

Essentially, the selector tag we are using is just sugar. It hold not value outside of the development process. If we are obfuscating those generated selectors will output in a short-name variation, as an example, the above code would output something like this:

```js
m(
  "div.a.b"
  m(
    "div.c.d.e",
    m("ul.f",
      m("li.g", "one"),
      m("li.g", "two"),
      m("li.g", { class: 'h i' }, "three")
    )
  )
);
```

> When you only need to express the class name itself, use `m.css.class('name')`

#### Caveats

There are a couple of very minor caveats to this approach, they are listed below:

1. You cannot pass variables and must express classes as value wrapped in quotation characters
2. You cannot perform actions on supplied selectors, eg: `m.css.div(i > 1 ? 'foo' : 'bar')`
