# ðŸª¡ mcss (alpha-release)

MCSS is a build time development extension/plugin that provides class selector completion and obfuscation support for [mithril](https://mithril.js.org) projects using Rollup. The plugin creates a [fugazi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh1HI-ag7HA) method on the `m` export that provides selector completion and obfuscation capabilities to developers separating stylesheets and scripts.

> This tool is developed for use with [mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org). It cannot be appropriated into different frameworks.

### Why?

I develop a lot with the esoteric framework known as [mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org) and in addition choose HyperScript instead of JSX (I live in a society, I'm not an animal). When working on large projects, I tend to keep my styles and scripts separate from one another and there was no way to couple them aside from using my memory. Having looked into [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) I felt solutions like [BSS](https://github.com/porsager/bss) by [Porsager](https://github.com/porsager) to be a far better approach, especially with my stack tastes. After toying with the idea of auto-generating typings from stylesheets, I wrote a basic POC and it sufficed rather nicely and thus mcss was born.

## How it works

Mcss leverages Rollup and PostCSS. The module will parse your stylesheets and generate a type declaration file which contains all defined selector (class names) which is does via PostCSS. Using Rollup's plugin API it walks the generated acorn AST finds all instances of the fugazi `m.css` selector within JavaScript/TypeScript files and replaces it with the valid hyperscript equivalent.

#### Plugins

Mcss is just glorified rollup and postcss plugin. In order for one to leverage it in their projects you need to couple it with another rollup plugin which suppose or exposes a method that provides support for postcss. It does not matter which plugin you have, as long as you can implement postcss, below are the two most common:

- [rollup-plugin-postcss](https://github.com/egoist/rollup-plugin-postcss)
- [rollup-plugin-scss](https://github.com/thgh/rollup-plugin-scss)

#### Rollup Config

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import mcss from '@brixtol/mcss';
import postcss from 'rollup-plugin-postcss'


export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',
    format: 'es',
  },
  plugins: [
    mcss(),
    postcss({ plugins: [ mcss.postcss() ])
  ]
};

```

## Typings

Mcss will generate a `mcss.d.ts` declaration file populated with your class selectors that have been defined within stylesheets. The generated declaration will extend mithril's definitely typed [mithril.d.ts](https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.d.ts) `Static` interface and implement a fugazi `m.css.*` method on the `m` export. The `mcss.d.ts` file will be updated when you define or delete selectors within stylesheets.

#### TS/JS Config

Enable `esModuleInterop` or `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` options to import mithril's commonjs export format in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file. JavaScript projects mqy need to explicitly _include_ the location of your src files.

```json
{
  "include": ["src/*"], // sometimes required for js projects
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ES2020",
    "target": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM"],
    "moduleResolution": "Node",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

> Refer to the [@types/mithril](https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.d.ts) for more information.

## Obfuscation

Class names can be obfuscated. Obfuscation can help reduce bundle size because it renames classes to single letter and/or number combinations. This is very helpful when you are working on a large project as it reduces both the production size of your stylesheet and javascript files.

#### Before Obfuscation

Your css:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
.some-class-name {}
.another-class-name {}
.yet-another-class-name {}
```

Your mithril node:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
m('.some-class-name.another-class-name.yet-another-class-name');
```

#### After Obfuscation

Your css:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
.a {} // .some-class-name
.b {} // .another-class-name
.c {} // .yet-another-class-name
```

Your mithril node:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
m('.a.b.c');
```

## Usage

Below is an example using [rollup-plugin-scss](https://github.com/thgh/rollup-plugin-scss) which allows us to pass transpiled code to postCSS via its `processor` field. If you are not processing SASS/SCSS files then you can use the [rollup-plugin-postcss](https://github.com/egoist/rollup-plugin-postcss) plugin and add the `mcss.postcss()` method to its `plugins[]` field. The `mcss()` default export should be placed within rollup `plugins[]`. The `mcss()` default export is where you provide all options whereas `mcss.postcss()` does not accept any options, it's just a method.

> The plugin provides detailed JSDoc annotated descriptions of all options.

```js
import mcss from '@brixtol/mcss';
import scss from 'rollup-plugin-scss';
import sass from 'node-sass';
import postcss from 'postcss'
import clean from 'postcss-clean'
import autoprefixer from 'node-autoprefixer';
import { terser } from 'rollup-plugin-terser';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',
    format: 'es',
    sourcemap: false,
    plugins: [
      terser()
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    mcss({
      // Files to exclude
      include: [],
      // Files to exclude
      exclude: [],
      // Clear the cache before new builds
      clean: false,
      // Prints warnings about unknown selectors.
      warnUnknown: true,
      // Generate sourcemaps
      sourcemap: true,
      // When true, obfuscation is applied (defaults to false)
      obfuscate: false,
      // Where cached mappings are stored.
      cacheDir: 'node_modules/.cache/mcss',
      // Where the selector type declarations are stored
      typesDir: 'types/mcss.d.ts',
      // The alphabet is used to generate the new class names
      alphabet: 'abcefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789',
      // A list of class names to ignore.
      ignore: []
    }),
    scss({
      sass,
      output: 'dist/style.min.css',
      watch: 'src',
      processor: () => postcss([
        autoprefixer(),
        clean(),
        mcss.postcss() // Provide this as the last plugin
      ])
    })
  ]
};
```

#### Selector Example

The plugin allows selectors to be expressed as if they apart of the Mithril API via the `m.css` which is available as a method of the `m` default export. The generates type declarations which extend the mithril module will give the impression that mithril provides this method natively (FYI: It doesn't, it's a [fugazi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh1HI-ag7HA) method, _it's fairy dust, it's not fucking real_).

> It's important to note that the tag name, which one can normally be omitted in hyperScript is required when using mcss.

Below is an example of how you express mcss selectors:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import m from 'mithril'

m(
  m.css.div(
    'row',
    'jc-center'
  )
  , m(
    m.css.div(
      'col',
      'col-sm-6',
      'col-lg-12'
    )
  , m(
      m.css.ul('list')
      , m(m.css.li('list-item'), 'one')
      , m(m.css.li('list-item'), 'two')
      , m(m.css.li('list-item'), { class: m.css.class('foo', 'bar') } , 'three')
      , m(m.css.li('list-item'), {
        onclick: (e) => {
          e.target.className = 1 > 0
          ? m.css.class('new-list-item-class', 'another-class-in-your-stylesheet')
          : m.css.class('list-item', 'foo', 'bar')
        }
      }, 'four')
    )
  )
);
```

Rollup will convert all instances of the fugazi `m.css.*` selector when processing the output. Every `m.csc` selector that is encountered in your chunks will be swapped out and replaced with the valid hyperscript equivalent. This a fast process because we apply these transformation directly on the AST. The above example would output the following:

```js
m(
  "div.row.jc-center"
  m(
    "div.col",
    m("ul.list",
      m("li.list-item", "one"),
      m("li.list-item", "two"),
      m("li.list-item", { class: 'foo bar' }, "three"),
      m("li.list-item"), {
        onclick: (e) => {
          e.target.className = 1 > 0
            ? "new-list-item-class another-class-in-your-stylesheet"
            : "list-item foo bar"
          )
        }
      }, "four")
    )
  )
);
```

The `m.css` selector tag we are using is just sugar and it holds not value outside of the development process, it merely provides us the capabilities of selector completion and a nice way to express selector class names. Because mcss is generating a mapped reference of selectors defined with stylesheets it also provides obfuscation capabilities. By default, mcss will not run obfuscation in transforms, you must enable this by setting `obfuscate` to `true` in the options.

When obfuscate is enabled all class names defined in stylesheets and all the selectors of `m.css` will be replaced with a short-name variation which is auto-generated according the `alphabet` sequence provided. The above code would output something like this:

```js
m(
 "div.a.b"
  m(
    "div.c.d.e",
    m("ul.f",
      m("li.g", "one"),
      m("li.g", "two"),
      m("li.g", { class: 'h i' }, "three"),
      m("li.g"), {
        onclick: (e) => {
          e.target.className = 1 > 0
            ? "j k"
            : "g h i"
          )
        }
      }, "four")
    )
  )
);
```

#### ClassName Selectors

In the above examples, you will notice in `onclick` and `class` that we are using `m.css.class()` to define our selectors. The `m.css.class()` method will transform selectors and separate them with a single whitespace character. All other methods of `m.css.*` which represent valid HTML tag names will transform using dot `.` separators.

## Unknown Selectors

When mcss encounters a selector that is not defined in your stylesheets it will print a warning to the console which list all the class names missing from stylesheets but defined as selectors. You can suppress this warning by setting the `warnUnknown` option to `false` or alternatively you can them to the `ignore[]` option.

The module assumes that all selectors expressed in the `m.css.*` method are css class names defined in stylesheets.

## Caveats

There are a couple of very minor caveats to this approach. When you are using mcss, you are not required to define every selector with it, so in situations where mcss cannot suffice, use the traditional approach.

#### Maps before bundles in build mode

Mcss will create couple of cache files after reading stylesheets. These files contain JSON references of your class name which are used when generating types declarations and obfuscating selectors. Because mcss is Rollup integrated solution that couples PostCSS via third party plugins the cache files which get generated from the stylesheets are processed as assets and their output is handled separate from chunk generation.

When operating in watch mode this is not an issue as mcss will execute a rebuild upon map generation after PostCSS has processed styles. When operating in build mode (ie: generating production bundles) and if obfuscation is enabled then mcss will need to generate a class name obfuscation mapping. The problem here that that can only be done in the post-build cycle which means in situations where an obfuscation cache mapping does not exists, you will need to execute a rebuild of the project a second time.

#### Do not provide dynamic selectors

Mcss is not intelligent enough to understand dynamic selectors, ie: selectors which are defined as a variable or data reference value. The class names you provide to the `m.css` method need to be string values wrapped in quotation characters, for example:

```js
import m from 'mithril';

const selector = 'my-button';

// DO NOT DO THIS

m(m.css.div('foo', 'bar', selector));

// DO THIS INSTEAD

m(m.css.div('foo', 'bar') + `.${selector}`);
```

#### Do not perform actions within the selector

Similar to mcss not supporting dynamic selectors, you cannot perform actions within the `m.css` selector. This means that conditional expressions will not work, for example:

```js
import m from 'mithril';

// DO NOT DO THIS

m(m.css.div(i > 1 ? 'foo' : 'bar'));

// DO THIS INSTEAD

m(i > 1 ? m.css.div('foo') : m.css.div('bar'));
```

`m.css.div(i > 1 ? 'foo' : 'bar')`
